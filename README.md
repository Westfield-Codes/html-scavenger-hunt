These get harder as you go.  The colors may not match, so ask about them
1. What are the blue parts (light) | yellow parts (dark)?  Like <body>
2. What is true about ALL of these (the starts and ends)?
3. What is true about MOST of these (coming in pairs)?
4. What does it mean when one of these begins with <! ?
5. What is true about SOME of these (contents for HREF links and SRC images)?
6. What is the difference between the first and second "My Dog" in the **code**?
7. What is the difference between the first and second "My Dog" in the **browser**?
8. Can you hide lines 4 and 5 (meta tags, which we don't need to know about now)?
9. Why is the second My Dog rendered red in the browser?
10. What do the indentations "mean"?  What do they "do"?
